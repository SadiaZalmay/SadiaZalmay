## Hi there <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d04509037f646eab5c2d6d130574ef059fa8eef92e45a139a827a8d06e9d5042/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966" alt="Emoji" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>  

I'm <b>Sadia</b>, a rising senior computer science student from New York, USA.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack web development** and currently focused on the school curriculum and problem-solving specific to health-based projects. ðŸ“š

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products, as well as apps that have over 100 million installs. Therefore, I am enhancing my app development skills and exploring anything that sparks my interest with a meaningful outcome. I have an imaginative mind that enables me to conceive innovative ideas, and I am learning the skills to implement them.

Outside of school, I'm interested in keeping up with developments in science. I also play chessâ™Ÿand enjoy brain-teasing games.
