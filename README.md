## Hi there 
I'm <b>Sadia</b>, a rising senior computer science student from New York, USA.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack web development** and currently focused on the school curriculum and problem-solving specific to health-based projects. ðŸ“š

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products, as well as apps that have over 100 million installs. Therefore, I am enhancing my app development skills and exploring anything that sparks my interest with a meaningful outcome. I have an imaginative mind that enables me to conceive innovative ideas, and I am learning the skills to implement them.

Outside of school, I'm interested in keeping up with developments in science. I also play chessâ™Ÿand enjoy brain-teasing games.
